# Contributing

Contributions should be small, reviewable, and safe to discuss publicly.

Before opening a pull request:

1. Keep runtime credentials, local state, generated artifacts, private paths,
   and raw logs out of the diff.
2. Add or update tests when behavior changes.
3. Run the repository's documented checks where practical.
4. State whether the change is source-only.

The following actions remain separate approval gates and must not be bundled
into ordinary contribution PRs: visibility changes, release/tag/package publish,
production deploy/restart/reload, database mutation, provider/Telegram live
sends, credential movement, force-push/history rewrite, or other destructive
operations.
